## World modelers 6-month evaluation

To reproduce results, run run\_eval.py in Python 3. The basic requirement
is INDRA (http://github.com/sorgerlab/indra), and the script assumes
that various reader outputs are available in subfolders. The details of where
these files need to be placed will be documented soon.
